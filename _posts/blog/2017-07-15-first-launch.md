It took me quite a while to get this site to work the way I want it to be.
This blog will mainly be use as a platform to share some of my studies.

I'll share some of the technical or non-technical knowledge I learned through the form of study note. From computer languages to hardware knowledge, even technological news, I'll cover whatever I come across.

In every post, there are comment section in the bottom of the page, feel free to discuss on the related subject. But no spams or ads. Just...NO...

This platform will also be the place where I'll be updating my online novel, which has been in production limbo for a long while. I'll move them here and start writing again in my spare time.
